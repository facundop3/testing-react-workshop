# Testing UI with [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

Hello there 👋, this will be a brief introduction to some basic UI testing using this powerful tool.

Some instructions:
  - Keep the focus on the `src/__test__/` directory, thats the main purpose of this.
  - Each `.js` file on the `src/__test__/` will have a same named `.md` with some additional info.

 ## [Start ➡️](/src/__tests__/jest-elevator-pitch.md)
